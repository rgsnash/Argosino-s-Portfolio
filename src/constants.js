  pc: `This is my PC. I work mostly in JavaScript. I have experience using the MERN stack, which involves MongoDB for the database, ExpressJS, ReactJS, and NodeJS. 
    Here is my <a href="https://github.com/rgsnash" target="_blank">Github</a>! Check out my work! I am also studying React Native, PHP, and Python.
    I do UI design and graphics editing in Figma for my church organization as well.`,

  "cs-degree": `This is my future diploma in Computer Science. I hung it on the wall because I am manifesting it, and I should be proud of it. 
    It was a very theoretical degree, but I believe it gave me a good foundation.`,

  "sofa-table": `That's my sofa. I like to relax here and spend my leisure time.`,

  tv: `That's my TV. This is where I watch K-Dramas. I have watched hundreds of K-Dramas here, so I guess I can call myself a K-Drama addict.
    I usually watch them on: <a href="https://asianc.sh/" target="_blank">Dramacool</a> (mostly K-Dramas or C-dramas), or 
    <a href="https://sflix.pages.dev/movie/1226578" target="_blank">Sflix</a> (for all kinds of movies and TV dramas from around the world)!`,

  bed: `This is where I sleep. Great ideas often come to me when I'm lying on my bed. When an idea strikes, I have to write it down, or I won't be able to sleep because it keeps running through my mind.`,

  resume: `This is my desk, and on it is my resume. <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DmqYYAyD2W2rz5oc9zH_dgqVHrQ_62lp/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Check it out?</a>
    Feel free to contact me at ashleyargosino1@gmail.com if you have any interesting job opportunities!`,

  projects: `Here are some of my projects:
    - **Face Recognition using Python**: Implemented a face recognition system using Python and OpenCV. Achieved live recognition of faces, identifying names using machine learning.
    - **Note App**: Developed a basic note app using Flutter and Firebase to expand my programming knowledge.
    - **Web Development**: Built a web application using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack.
    Learned the fundamentals of building web applications using these key JavaScript-based technologies.`,
